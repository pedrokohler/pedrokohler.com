I\'ve known the game since a little kid, but I just recently started playing it more consistently. Also, I\'ve been following lots of chess youtubers lately, like Eric Rosen, GothamChess, Hikaru and so on.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              As a matter of fact, I\'m a <a class="styled" href="https://www.chess.com/member/kohler1000" target="_blank">chess.com diamond member</a> since May 2020 and I\'ve been playing it daily since then. One could even say it has become one of my most recent passions.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              It turns out that I\'m also a web developer specializing in JavaScript and it would be awesome if I could be part of your team. Because in this way I\'d be able to unite two of my passions and make a living out of it.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              I was very interested in the position of Chess Explanation Developer. I always analyze my games after playing them, and sometimes it\'s really a mystery why the computer evaluates a position the way it does.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              I firmly believe I\'m able to fill this position. My last full-time job was in the largest solar systems company in Brazil. There, I was the main person responsible for a very complex engineering algorithm. Unfortunately I can\'t show you the code because of non-disclosure agreements, but it took me almost a whole year to finish the algorithm that is now in production at <a class="styled" href="https://app.sicessolar.com">Sices Solar</a> and it\'s used by thousands of customers daily.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              I coded the whole thing with Node.js and Typescript. My ex-manager in this company, Cristiane Lunardi, left me a recommendation in <a class="styled" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedrokohler/">LinkedIn</a>, sadly it is in portuguese, but I reckon google translator can help you figure out what it means, I also took the liberty of translating it and putting it down below, just in case.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              You can also check my github profile where I have some recreational projects that can show you a little bit about my skills. I\'ll cite just a few and explain them briefly, more info about them can be found in their respective repository.\n              <ul>\n                <li><a class="styled" href="https://github.com/pedrokohler/song-ballot">Song Ballot</a>: App for a fun game that I play with friends.
